[简体中文](documents/README__zh_CN.md)

## 1. abstract

- A lightweight and highly configurable Minecraft mod that tweaks **death penalties**, level-up **experience requirements**, and the default attributes of newly spawned entities
- mod id = `i_feel_bad`
- **LICENSE** = `GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0`

## 2. introduce

- `i_feel_bad` has introduced the following tweaks:
  - Enhancing death penalties
    - Re-balanced respawn state:
      - After death, player attributes are recalculated, turning respawning into a genuine setback instead of the vanilla “free refill” of hunger and health (especially when  `keep_inventory`  is on).
    - Post-respawn debuffs:
      - Players respawn with negative status effects that last for a configurable duration, forcing more cautious play.
  - Additional tweaks
    - Experience rework:
      - Optionally replaces Minecraft’s exponential level curve with linear or flat progression.
    - Mob attribute editing:
      - Lets you adjust the base attributes of any mob as it spawns, enabling fine-grained buffs or nerfs.
- Every feature can be toggled independently and comes with extensive configuration options; disable anything you don’t need—no side effects.

## 3. server or client

- This is a pure server-side module
- If used on the dedicated server, this module is not necessary on the client side
- Single-player or LAN play is also supported

## 4. config

- Below is a typical default configuration file (NeoForge version):

## 5. notes

- Due to some technical reasons, the `fabric` version of this mod:
  - does not support hot-reloading of config files (i.e., updating while the game is running); a restart is required for any changes to take effect
  - does not generate comments inside the config file
  - does not validate the config file; invalid entries may cause crashes or other issues
  - the Fabric port was added later, so additional problems may exist
- If you have any suggestions regarding the function implementation, or if you need other functions, you can raise an issue
